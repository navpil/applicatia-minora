# Applicatia Minora

This is a "Work" project where I solved various minor tasks without any intention of redistributing it.

Usually the code which does not deserve a separate repo is added here

## Quine

Prints out itself.

## chords

Project to test just tuning and show its problems.

## dice

Trying to find a combination for 6D dice faces, which would fit into the "four coins pattern".

When you drop four coins, you have these probabilities:

 - All heads / all tails - 1/16 each
 - One head / one tail - 1/4 each
 - Two heads + two tails - 3/8

Is it possible to simulate it with 6D dice?

What about "three coins pattern"?

The "coin patterns" are used in ancient games, such as Bul or Game of Ur.
